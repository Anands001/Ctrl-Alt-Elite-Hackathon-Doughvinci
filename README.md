# Ctrl-Alt-Elite-Hackathon-Doughvinci

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Ctrl-Alt-Elite-Hackathon-Doughvinci" project repository! This project was developed as an approach for a hackathon challenge, focusing on optimizing delivery systems. The main objective is to efficiently group orders, optimize delivery routes, and assign delivery batches to riders. While the project is currently in its conceptual phase, it outlines key ideas and strategies for improving delivery efficiency.

## Features

- **Order Grouping**: Concept for grouping orders based on proximity and pickup times to streamline delivery processes.
- **Route Optimization**: Approach for optimizing delivery routes by calculating a central point among order locations.
- **Rider Assignment**: Strategy for assigning delivery batches to the nearest available riders to minimize travel time.
- **Visualization**: Plan for visualizing orders, delivery batches, and rider locations using a plotting library.


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Matplotlib (for future visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development and experimentation)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anands001/Ctrl-Alt-Elite-Hackathon-Doughvinci.git
    cd Ctrl-Alt-Elite-Hackathon-Doughvinci
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the approach**:
    - The project currently includes concepts and scripts outlining the approach for delivery optimization.

## Usage

This repository primarily contains the outline of an approach for optimizing delivery systems. To understand and potentially extend this approach, follow these steps:

1. **Review the Approach**:
    - Explore the provided Python scripts and documentation to understand the proposed strategies for order grouping, route optimization, and rider assignment.

2. **Experiment with the Code**:
    - Modify and run the scripts to test the outlined approach. Customize the parameters to see how different configurations affect the delivery optimization.

3. **Develop Further**:
    - Use this repository as a starting point to develop a full-fledged solution for delivery optimization.

## Approach Overview

1. **Order Grouping**:
    - Orders are proposed to be grouped based on several rules such as proximity to kitchens or customers and similarity in pickup times. This approach aims to minimize the number of trips needed for deliveries.

2. **Route Optimization**:
    - The approach involves calculating the centroid of order locations to determine the optimal delivery route. This minimizes the total travel distance for the riders.

3. **Rider Assignment**:
    - Delivery batches are assigned to riders based on the proximity of the riders' current location to the batch's destination. This ensures that the nearest available rider is always assigned to a delivery, reducing wait times and improving efficiency.
